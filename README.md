# GerrymanderProject
This is a gerrymander project for Precal (Shaun)

### Members:

    Rocky Shao
    Lucas Matthingly

### Goal:
    input an image and determine:
        (1) the contiguos of this district
        (2) the compactness of this district
    
Setup:
    1.Download python 3 on https://www.python.org/downloads/
    2.Download vscode at https://code.visualstudio.com/download
    3.Create a new empty folder
    4.Click on the folder, then right click the folder, select "open in terminal"
    5.Type in the following commands in the terminal:
            (1):    git clone https://github.com/Rocky0Shao/GerrymanderProject.git
            (2):    pip install opencv-python
    You're ready to go!

Math:
    1. For Compactness:
        (1): For a circle, the compactness will be 1
        (2): The general formula: 4pi * (A/P^2), where A is the area of the district, P is the parameter of the district
        (3): For visualizatoin, will draw a circle on the district. 
             The circle has the same area as the district, and centered at the center of the district
