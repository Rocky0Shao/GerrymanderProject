Here is our program that can detect the factors of voting districts that contribute to gerrymandering. 
Gerrymandering, the manipulation of district boundaries to benefit a particular political party or group, 
is a serious issue that undermines the integrity of democratic elections.  
It can result in the unfair representation of certain communities, the suppression of minority voices, 
and the consolidation of power in the hands of a select few.  


Our program aims to allow the user to input an image of a voting district and establish the values of the contiguous and compactness of the district.
These values will allow the user to then calculate whether or not the district has fallen victim to political gerrymandering or not.  
In addition, the program can aid the user in determining what group or groups have been suppressed.  


We hope that our program can lead to the removal of gerrymandered voting districts and the unfair representation of minority groups and communities.  
In turn, this will allow us to hold fair and impartial elections and promote greater transparency and acountability in the political process.  
We believe that developing a reliable and accurate tool to detect gerrymandering, we can ensure that all voices are heard and all communities are represented fairly in our democracy.
